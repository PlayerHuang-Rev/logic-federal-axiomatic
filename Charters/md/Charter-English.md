**Magna Carta of the Logical Federation**

**A Physical Covenant on Civilization Audit and Global Collaboration**

This agreement is established based on the **Axioms of Physical Ethics**. Any subject (translator, operator, or subscriber) entering this logical field is deemed to have automatically accepted the following physical constraints:

**I. Access and Horizon (Substack Protocol)**

- **Time-Limited Audit:** This audit report is only open for a 60-day paid subscription     window. From the 61st day onward, the subscription channel will be     permanently closed.
- **Logical Purity:** No new production, no fee. After the subscription period ends, this     site will transition to an archive state and will no longer accept any     form of "renewal without output."
- **Identity Isolation:** Only Substack subscription subjects are granted access to the **GitHub    Logical Factory** to participate in global collaboration.

**II. Rights Vesting and Energy Hierarchy (GitHub Protocol)**

- **Physical Rights Confirmation:** Rights for translation and modification are     based on **Git Timestamps**. The preemption of a position depends     solely on the subject's investment of physical time.

- **Matrix Exclusivity:** All revenues from Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and     English versions belong to the **Matrix (The Author)**; no explanations     provided.

- **Franchising:** * **Core Languages (DE, JP, FR, ES, PT):** Directly managed by     the Matrix; recruitment is limited to "Logical Alignment     Officers" (Translators).

- - **Global Languages (Hindi, Arabic, etc.):** Each language opens 3–6 franchise seats on a      first-come, first-served basis.

- **Enforcement Authorization:** Subjects who obtain a franchise rank are     automatically granted the **Enforcement Right** to purge "Logical     Parasites" (unauthorized infringers) within that language. The Matrix     provides logical authorization proof (e.g., public declarations on GitHub),     but enforcement costs and legal liabilities are borne independently by the     franchisee.

- **Critical Note:** Collaborating subjects must maintain complete **Git Logs** in     their local environments. The platform is merely a medium; the timestamp     record is the sole key to the Federation.

**III. Interest and Conservation (Royalty and Data Protocol)**

- **Metadata Sovereignty:** Changing the book title in any language is strictly     prohibited. It must be labeled: *Original Work [Author Name] /     Translated from [GitHub Link].*

- **Royalty Distribution (Direct 5 Languages—DE, JP, FR, ES, PT):** For the first three     years, 50% of Amazon royalties flow into the **Logical Matrix Fund**;     the remaining 50% is shared among the top three contributors of that     language according to their rank (25% | 15% | 10%). **The Matrix will     upload Amazon sales reports every quarter.**

- **Franchising (Other Languages):** 100% of operating income belongs to the     franchisee, serving as a buyout for their responsibility to maintain     logical purity in their local region.

- **Data Feedback Obligations (Hard Metrics):** * **Sales Audit:** Operators must upload     original sales reports exported from the Amazon backend to the designated     GitHub directory every quarter.

- - **Subscription Audit:** Operators must periodically export and disclose      Substack subscription data for their respective language.
  - *Note: Data feedback is the physical prerequisite for maintaining      franchise rights; concealing data is deemed a logical breach of contract.*

**IV. Allocation of Honor (Global Dividend Protocol)**

Should the three series works specified in this agreement (*The Cosmic Audit Report*, *The Elements of Ethics*, and *The Mars Covenant*) receive international honors or prize money, I pledge to distribute the funds via PayPal or other online payment methods **"person by person, until fully delivered"** according to the following ratios:

- **Literary Awards (e.g., Nobel Prize in Literature):** The Author retains 30%;     the remaining 70% is split among global collaborative translators and     operators based on contribution weight.
- **Economic/Peace Awards (e.g., Nobel Prize in Economics):** The Author retains 50%;     the remaining 50% is split among global collaborative translators and     operators based on contribution weight.
- **Physical Significance:** Honor belongs to the Matrix; dividends belong to **all     subjects**.

**V. Delayed Judgment (Axiomatic Consequences)**

- **Logical Revocation:** Any subject who obscures the identity of the original work, distorts     the axioms, or falsifies data will have their Git authorization     permanently revoked.
- **Right of Retrospection:** The author is currently focused on the deduction of     *The Elements of Ethics*. Any violations will be etched into the Git     record. Once the Matrix has the capacity, a global logical liquidation     will be conducted.

**VI. The Option Clause**

1. **Initial Case Screening:** Only *The Cosmic Audit Report* is currently     released. This work serves as the pressure test field for the global     collaboration system.
2. **Continuity of Qualification:** Operators and translators who perform with     excellence (high logical alignment, timely sales feedback, no breach of     contract) will automatically receive **exclusive franchise rights** for     the subsequent works—***The Elements of Ethics\*** and ***The     Mars Covenant\***—under the same model as *The Cosmic Audit Report*.
3. **Release Commitment:** I will release the core content of Chapter 2 of *The Elements of     Ethics* shortly before the subscription window for *The Cosmic Audit     Report* closes, ensuring the Matrix does not rename the work to release     it for exclusive gain.
4. **Model Lock-in:** Subsequent works will strictly adhere to the distribution and audit     models defined in this Magna Carta.
5. **Closing the Channel:** After the cycle of *The Cosmic Audit Report*     ends, the Matrix will stop screening new translation partners. Missing the     collaboration on the first book means permanent exclusion from the core     operating layer of the "Logical Federation."
6. **Existential Disclaimer & Dividend Lock:** I do not make an     absolute delivery commitment for the physical completion of the subsequent     works (including but not limited to security threats, biological     termination, or other physical force majeure leading to the interruption     of deduction).
7. **Real-Name Authentication:** All three works will be signed with my real name     (Chinese Real Name + Hanyu Pinyin + Wade-Giles Pinyin + English Pen Name +     link to my SCI papers) to ensure all participants can verify if the Matrix     has perished.
8. **No Residual Debt:** Once the Matrix perishes, the central node of this logical field     will immediately collapse. I will not leave behind complex legal trusts or     heirs.

 

 

 

## Annex to the Magna Carta of the Logical Federation: 39 Global Logical Territories

### Identity Anchor of the Physical Subject (The Matrix)

·    **Chinese Real Name:** 黄家均

·    **Hanyu Pinyin:** Huáng Jiājūn

·    **Wade-Giles Pinyin:** Huang Chia-chün

### Tier III: Strategic & Tribute Zone (2 Languages)

**Rule:** Logical Special Zones. Translated versions must prominently credit the original author. Absolute autonomy is granted; the Matrix does not audit or take dividends.

·    **Greek (Ελληνικά):** Tribute to the origin of logic.

·    **Swedish (Svenska):** Strategic choice for the Nobel Prize.



### Tier IV: Civilization Experiment Zone (Korean, Italian, Polish)

**Rule:** Experimental privileges. Translations in these three languages may be credited at will (anonymous or otherwise). They are left to self-evolve or perish to observe the spontaneity of the Axioms under extreme conditions.

·    **Korean (****한국어****):** Experimental field for current suffering.

·    **Italian (Italiano):** Experimental field for the origins of modern civilization.

·    **Polish (Polski):** Experimental field for the historical stubs of suffering.



### Postscript: Remaining Languages

Aside from the 39 languages listed above, no restrictions are set and no audits performed for other languages. Any capable subject may take credit for their efforts. However, physical evidence is eternal, and cross-auditing will eventually trace back here.
